Group 1: Michele Aguilar, Monica Dorsey, Mayra Martinez, Nicholas Armada

Our team decided to investigate: The Effects and Trends of Social Media on Mental Health
Goal: To explore the effects and trends of social media on mental health by analyzing real data.

Questions Addressed:
Monica: Are there correlations between passive scrolling engagement (e.g., passive scrolling vs. active posting) and mental health metrics?
Michele: What is the correlation between the frequency or duration of social media use and mental health outcomes like anxiety, depression, or loneliness?
Michele: Is there evidence that social media increases feelings of loneliness or isolation, especially in younger users?
Nicholas: Are there notable differences in how social media impacts mental health across age groups (e.g., teens vs. young adults vs. older adults)?
Mayra: How do different platforms (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, Facebook) impact mental health differently?

# How we got our data
Kaggle: Social Media and Mental Health
Kaggle:  Mental Health & Technology Usage Dataset 


# Analysis
We found this
1. Individuals with greater passive social media usage show higher median depression scores. This Suggests a positive correlation between passive scrolling and increased depression levels
2. There doesnâ€™t seem to be an age-related correlation between social media usage duration and self-reported stress levels and mental health statuses.
3.  Elevated depression levels linked to both high passive scrolling and total social media time. Suggests that combined high usage may amplify negative mental health impacts.
4. People tend to seek more valdation from Facebook and Instagram. The data suggests that people will tend to share more informaiton on Facebook and Instagram to get postivie validation.
